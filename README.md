# Bacterial Diversity Dashboard

## The challenge
Build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## File Directory
- static folder holds `app.js` file where the bulk of our visuals are made
- data folder contains all the `.json` files used
- Images holds screenshots of the dashboard

## Results
*Operational taxonomic units(OTUs) are labeled with present count of baterial volume at time of measuring*
